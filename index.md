## About Me

I lead a small but amazing team of developers and designers to make big ideas for the web at [Four Kitchens](http://fourkitchens.com/), a design and development firm in [Austin, Texas](https://www.google.com/maps/preview/place/Austin,+TX/). When I'm not in a meeting I'm working with [Drupal](http://drupal.org) and [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

On the rare occasion when I'm not working I seam to split my time between an very changing and frighteningly diverse array of hobbies. I ride my bike to work most days, and am never shy about taking my bike appart. I play with LEDs and microcontrols, I play with Legos I play board games. I've built furniture, sets for movies and more than a few art cars.

I love my wife. My dogs, Chloe and Tesla, and my famlie(s). I love the internet, I love freedom and I love BBQ.

When I grow up I'll spend my days helping keep the internet free and exploring outer space.

[Nicola Tesla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla), [Harper Reed](http://harperreed.com/) and [Dries Buytaert](http://buytaert.net/) inspire me.
